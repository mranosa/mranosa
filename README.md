## 🧭 How I add value
- 🌍 **Public-impact builder** — work that helps people at scale  
- 🕸️ **Systems thinker** — explicit trade-offs (consistency/latency/cost)  
- 🧮 **Team multiplier** — tools and patterns others reuse  
- 🤝 **Partner/evangelist** — aligns PM/Design/Eng early  
- 🧯 **Crisis engineer** — calm in incidents; durable fixes  
- ♻️ **Periodic reset, higher bar** — declutter → better versions

## 🏆 Edge
> What I do best, with proof.

- ⏳ **Deliver under deadline** — features tied to **>$1M** in deals  
- 🏎️ **Make teams faster** — **600%** faster tests; **hours → seconds** integration  
- 🧰 **Enable the team** — generator cut setup **2 weeks → 1 minute**; adopted by **8** engineers  
- 🧱 **Full-stack with test discipline** — TypeScript/Node/React + GraphQL + CI  
- 🚢 **Bias to ship** — founder experience; shipped side projects  
- 🌐 **Remote-proven** — reliable across time zones

## 🧩 Gaps
> Known gaps and active fixes.

- 🧘 **Avoiding overwork** → 3 focused blocks/day  
- 🆘 **Ask for help earlier** → “ask-by” + short RFC/Loom  
- 🧭 **Align before building** → 1-page brief + early demo  
- 🎯 **Protect focus** → 1–3 goals/week + public done list  
- 🛡️ **Infra specialization** → partner with SREs; own CI/tests/observability  
- ♿ **Design/a11y depth** → checklist + Lighthouse
